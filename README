Repository Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/opennetworks.git
   cd opennetworks

2. Set up .gitignore to exclude sensitive files:
   utilities/local_paths.py
   .idea/
   *.log

3. Create a local_paths.py file from the example:
   cp utilities/local_paths.py.example utilities/local_paths.py

   Fill in your local paths for browser drivers:
   CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/chromedriver"
   MSEDGEDRIVER_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/msedgedriver"
   FIREFOXDRIVER_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/geckodriver"

4. Update config.py if needed:
   BROWSER = "chrome"  # options: "firefox", "chrome", "edge"
   BASE_URL = "https://opennetworks.org/"

Running Tests

Run all tests:
   pytest

Run a single test file:
   pytest tests/test_Learn_more.py

Run a single test method:
   pytest tests/test_Learn_more.py::TestMPLearnMore::test_title_page

---

Notes

- Make sure your browser drivers match your installed browser versions.
- local_paths.py should never be committed; it contains local absolute paths.

---

Troubleshooting

- If you see WebDriver or browser errors, double-check paths in local_paths.py.
- Ensure Python, Selenium, and WebDriver Manager are installed correctly.
- For Git issues, make sure you have a GitHub account and proper remote URL configured.
